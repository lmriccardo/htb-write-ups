## OPENING THE SITE

- Opening `http://{IP}:8080/` being redirected to `http://{IP}:8443/manage/account/login?...`
- Found software named **UniFi 6.4.54** (JAVA backend)

> *UniFi* is a community of wireless access points, switches, routers, controller devices, 
> VoIP phones, and access control products. It can be used for the corporate network and 
> also for the home network. An Unifi network controller manages all the equipment in the 
> UNIFI network.

- There is a CVE [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) releated to UniFi
- The vulnerability is a *Log4J Remote Code Execution*

> *CVE-2021-44228*: Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 JNDI features used in configuration,
> log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI 
> releated endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can 
> execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup subtitution is enabled

> *JNDI* (Java Naming and Directory Interface) is the naming service used to register services 
> in distributed contexts and recall them using a mnemonic name. This is a register that 
> maintains the association between a name and an application server service in a data structure.
> JNDI managed objects are stored in binding files. This storage can be based on file systems or 
> LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)

> *LDAP* (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a mature, flexible, and well supported 
> standards-based mechanism for interacting with directory servers. Itâ€™s often used for 
> authentication and storing information about users, groups, and applications, but an LDAP 
> directory server is a fairly general-purpose data store and can be used in a wide variety 
> of applications. In LDAP all informations are encrypted and transmitted using BER
> (Basic Encoding Rules).

- Interesting port for LDAP are

1. 389/TCP Clear-Text connection
2. 636/TCP Encrypted Connection

- Let's try to use BurpSuite as the middle-man to see requests
- Set up a Manual proxy on localhost:8080
- When given credentials to access this is the request
